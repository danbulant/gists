# Aztec deprecation

Aztec is currently in the deprecation process and will be shut down soon. To continue using Aztec, you can instead [invite](https://top.gg/bot/739864286775738399) igni, which can replace Aztec fully while also improving the overall experience. You can learn more about igni [here](README.md).

## Just to name a few improvements

* Giveaways now work longer than just few hours and can have rules like number of messages
* Message number counting
* Working invite manager
* Counting channels
* More log events
* Custom aliases
* Less bugs
